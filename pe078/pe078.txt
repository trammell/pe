Problem 78
10 September 2004

Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be
separated into piles. For example, five coins can separated into piles in
exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

    1   OOOOO
    2   OOOO O
    3   OOO OO
    4   OOO O O
    5   OO OO O
    6   OO O O O
    7   O O O O O

Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.

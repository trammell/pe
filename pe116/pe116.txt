Problem 116
03 March 2006

A row of five black square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced with
coloured oblong tiles chosen from red (length two), green (length three), or
blue (length four).

If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.

[using R=red, G=green, B=blue, K=black]

    RRKKK
    KRRKK
    KKRRK
    KKKRR
    RRRRK
    RRKRR
    RRRRK

If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.

    GGGKK
    KGGGK
    KKGGG

And if blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.

    KBBBB
    BBBBK

Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 ways of
replacing the black tiles in a row measuring five units in length.

How many different ways can the black tiles in a row measuring fifty units in
length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at least one coloured tile
must be used?

NOTE: This is related to problem 117.

Analysis:

N(0,red) = 0 ("")
N(1,red) = 0 ("K")
N(2,red) = 1 ("RR" "KK")
N(3,red) = 2 ("RRK" "KRR" "KKK")
N(4,red) = 4 ("RRRR" "RRKK" "KRRK" "KKRR", "KKKK")

This  is just the fibonacci series, minus 1

for N(i,green)

   TG(i) = TG(i-1) + TG(i-3)

What is the name of this?  Generalized fibonacci series?

for N(i,blue)

   TB(i) = TB(i-1) + TB(i-4)

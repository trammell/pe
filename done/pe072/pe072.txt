Problem 72
18 June 2004

Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and
HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d <= 8 in ascending
order of size, we get:

    1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2,
    4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.

How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions
for d <= 1,000,000?

Notes:

This is somewhat related to the totient function:

    The totient function phi(n), also called Euler's totient function, is
    defined as the number of positive integers <=n that are relatively
    prime to (i.e., do not contain any factor in common with) n, where 1 is
    counted as being relatively prime to all numbers. Since a number less
    than or equal to and relatively prime to a given number is called a
    totative, the totient function phi(n) can be simply defined as the
    number of totatives of n. For example, there are eight totatives of 24
    (1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23), so phi(24)=8. The totient function
    is implemented in Mathematica as EulerPhi[n]. ... The first few values
    of phi(n) for n=1,2,... are 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 6, 4, 10, ...
    (Sloane's A000010).

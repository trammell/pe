Problem 96
27 May 2005

Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular
puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to
Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea
called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to
replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row,
column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an
example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

    Starting puzzle grid:

        003 020 600
        900 305 001
        001 806 400

        008 102 900
        700 000 008
        006 708 200

        002 609 500
        800 203 009
        005 010 300

    Solution grid:

        483 921 657
        967 345 821
        251 876 493

        548 132 976
        729 564 138
        136 798 245

        372 689 514
        814 253 769
        695 417 382

A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved
by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods
in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this).
The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the
example above is considered easy because it can be solved by straight
forward direct deduction.

The 6K text file, sudoku.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all
with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).

By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in
the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit
number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.

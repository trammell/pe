Problem 187
22 March 2008

A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For example,
15=3x5; 9=3x3; 12=2x2x3.

There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not
necessarily distinct, prime factors: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.

How many composite integers, n < 10^8, have precisely two, not necessarily
distinct, prime factors?

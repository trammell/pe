Problem 86
07 January 2005

A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3,
and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of
the room the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is 10 and the
path is shown on the diagram.

   Textual description of image: The spider is at (x=0,y=0,z=0), the fly is
   at (x=6,y=5,z=3).  The path on the surface of the cuboid consists of
   segments connecting the points (0,0,0), (X,5,0), (6,5,3), X not
   specified here.

However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given
cuboid and the shortest route is not always integer.

By considering all cuboid rooms up to a maximum size of M by M by M, there
are exactly 2060 cuboids for which the shortest distance is integer when
M=100, and this is the least value of M for which the number of solutions
first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions is 1975 when M=99.

Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds
one million.

Analysis:

Pythagorean triples-- (6,8,10) is one

Example cuboid is (3,5,6) => are any of (3,11) or (5,9) or (6,8) the (a,b) legs in a
triple?

we're interested in both primitive and nonprimitive triples
